            <h3> How to make Garfield's Lasagna Recipe With Minced Meat And Italian Spices
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To begin crafting this recipe, firstly, preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut eggplants into thin circles and dredge with a teaspoon of salt.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Preparing Eggplants/ Mushroom</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Leave for ten minutes and then squeeze out water, pressing the eggplants between palms. Rub/bast olive oil on the eggplants and put into hot oven for ten minutes or till they change color and appear cooked. Keep aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If using mushrooms, mushrooms are to be quartered and sautéed with a teaspoon of olive oil until slightly done. It takes about 2 minutes on medium flame.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lasagna Pasta Sheets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In a large bring salted water to boil and put in the Del Monte lasagne pasta sheets. Allow it to cook to al dente- about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and drain. Drizzle a little olive oil over them so they don't stick.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large frying pan, add enough oil, heat and fry the onions till translucent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the garlic and then the minced meat. Let it brown a bit and then cover and cook over low heat, for ten minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the pureed tomatoes, the Del Monte pasta paste, herbs, pepper and salt and let it again cook on a low fire till the meat is a thick, mushy consistency. Add the fresh, torn basil leaves last.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep one tablespoon of cheese aside. In a bowl, beat eggs lightly, add the remaining cheeses, beat again and keep aside.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In a flat bottomed lasagna pan, ladle 1/3 rd of the meat sauce to cover the bottom.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gently place 3 pasta sheets to cover the meat, overlapping them a bit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scatter 1/3rd of the mushrooms or processed eggplants over the pasta.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use about 1/3 rd of the egg-cheese mixture to drizzle over the top of the mushrooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat the process till three layers of the sauce, pasta, veggies and egg sauce is done. Over the last layer of egg sauce, scatter the grated cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake at 180 degrees for an hour. Let it sit for about ten minutes before digging into it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The lasagne can be eaten with just some fresh salad like Carrot Beet Amaranth and Vanilla Panacotta for a welcoming accompaniment with a glass of wine.
                </li>
            </ul>

          <p>Garfield's Lasagna Recipe With Minced Meat And Italian Spices takes more time to be prepared but at the end of the baking when you smell this divine combination of minced meat between herbed lasagna pasta sheets, you will definitely feel that it was totally worth it.

            The lasagne can be eaten with just some fresh salad like Carrot Beet Amaranth and Vanilla Panacotta for a welcoming accompaniment with a glass of wine. Since nothing is deep fried in this dish and olive oil is used, it can be relatively healthy and quite filling.</p>
